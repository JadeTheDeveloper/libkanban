# NOTICE: LIBKANBAN WILL BE ARCHIVED BY NOV. 1
This project is no longer being maintained and will be suceeded by another Kanban board project down the line.
The technologies are just not up to date/too primitive to maintain a good, modern, scaleable project with an easy intuitive ui.
Apologies for the incovenience,


# libkanban
This project is an organizer tool that's meant to be a lightweight, open source replacement to tools like Trello.
This project utilizes pure Java code using java Swing code implementations.
